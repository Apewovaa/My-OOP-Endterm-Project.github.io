1)	First of all, an abstract User class was created, which we will inherit.
2)	Then an Admin class was created which manages all of them and extends our User class.
3)	Next, the IAdmin interface was created, which describes all the methods that will be used in the most basic code.
4)	Our main class was created that plays a role as a table in the Database. In this class, all the colonies were created in which we will enter all our data from the console.
5)  The DBManager class had a connection to our PostgreSQL application. All operations that occur in SQL are described in the DBManager class.
6)  The credit class is also available in our tables. Here people can take out a loan and see the loan history.
7)  The most recent is the menu of our banking system, how it will generally work and what functions will be visible exactly described in this RunMethod class.
8)  And these are the results of the banking system project.
